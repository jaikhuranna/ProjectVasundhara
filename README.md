# **Project Vasundhara**
Project Vasundharais an interactable VR application that gamifies learning chemistry in a super fun and immersive way. Combine elements and build the world around you. Learn how different elements build and influence the world around us.

This project was build during CAD 2.0 Hackathon hosted by Coding Ninjas SRM.

We used Unity, Blender, C#, OpenXR, XR Interation Toolkit and ShaderLab to build this project.

The problem Project Vasundhara solves

    Making chemistry more interesting and immersive.
    Providing a more hands-on and interactive approach to education.
    Depicting accurate 3D renders of Atoms, Molecules and Compounds.
    Making a platform for children to experience an innovative way of learning.
